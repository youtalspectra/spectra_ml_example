    "\n",
    "In movie review websites such as IMDB, users can type a review in raw text format and give a rating. The objective of this challenge is to build an AI that can predict as accurately as possible what the user rating of a movie is from their review. This part of a larger class of problems called sentiment analysis. To simplify the problem, we only consider two simple rating values that are 'positive' or 'negative'. The AI should be able to \"understand\" what makes a review polarised one way or the other. Using the given movie review dataset, your goal is to build a model that can predict whether an unseen movie review is positive or negative.\n"
