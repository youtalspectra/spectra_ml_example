    "A hotel chain wants to improve their demand management and pricing policy by predicting intraday bookings, that is customers who request a room during the day without any prior reservation. This intraday demand is affected by the hotel characteristics but also external effects such as adverse transport or weather events. Using the given hotel occupancy dataset, build a model that can predict how many people will come and occupy a room on any given day and hour (intraday booking).\n"
